                Genshin Impact's fantasy world, 'Teyvat', draws inspiration from real-world places such as Germany, China, Japan, France, and South America. Genshin also prides itself in its diverse range of playable characters which players can obtain either through simply playing the game or through its gacha monetization system. The game also allows for limited multiplayer gameplay that can host up to four players.

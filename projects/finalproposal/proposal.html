                Reason for choosing this topic
                <blockquote>
                    Genshin Impact has been one of my few long term interests. It is a relatively easy game to pick up but difficult to master due to its massive pool of content and complex game mechanics. With an estimated total of 2 years of Genshin experience under my belt, I've yet to learn everything there is to know about the game. I'd want to offer any assistance I can to new and even intermediate players such as myself.

                <blockquote>
                    There are two main methods whereby I'll be collecting information, images and content for my website. First will be through first-hand experience relying on my personal knowledge of Genshin Impact, and the second will be through online searching via Google. I could also reach out to the Genshin Impact community if I have any questions that I cannot find answers to online.

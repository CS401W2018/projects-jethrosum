        <h4>History</h4>
        <blockquote>R&B or Rhythm and blues is a genre of popular music that consists of a foundation of blues music with elements of jazz, gospel and funk mixed in. This genre originated in the 1940s within African-American communities. R&B music has evolved over time to incorporate new styles and influences such as soul elements, and electronic instrumentation like synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers.</blockquote>
        <h4>Modern R&B Music</h4>
        <blockquote>Modern R&B music is a diverse and evolving genre that incorporates a variety of sonic elements. Modern R&B music has merged with hip-hop, with many R&B artists collaborating with rappers to bring more upbeat sounds into their music. Some modern R&B artists include SZA, Frank Ocean, Summer Walker, Daniel Caesar, Doja Cat, Kehlani and Jhene Aiko.</blockquote>

        <h4>About Links</h4>
        <blockquote>A relative link is a URL that provides a path to file or page relative to it's current directory, rather then specifying the full web address. A relative link does not include the protocol (http/https) or domain name (eg. google.com). An example of a relative link is '/images/picture.jpg' or 'interestspage.html'. Here is another example of a relative link: <a href="/Relative/projectprofile.html">Previous Project</a></blockquote>
        <blockquote>An absolute link is complete URL that includes all necessary information such as the protocol (http/https), domain name (eg. google.com), the path (eg. /about/contact.html) and other optional elements. This allows a web browser to locate a specific resource regardless of the links directory. An example of an absolute link is 'https://www.britannica.com/quiz/browse'. Here is another example of an absolute link related to my interests page: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP">SZA</a></blockquote>

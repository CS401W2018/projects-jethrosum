        <p>SZA, or Solana Imani Rowe, is a Missouri-born African-American singer-songwriter.I enjoy listening to SZA's songs as her <span class="bolder">blending of elements of rhythm and blues, hip-hop, and soul</span>in her music which makes her sound unique. SZA has also written songs for other artists such as Rihanna's song "Consideration", and has worked with other artists like Beyonce and Nicki Minaj. Her debut studio album 'Ctrl' was released in 2017, while her sophomore album 'SOS' was released in 2022. Below are some of my personal favorite songs sang and written by SZA:</p>
        <h4 class="subheading">'Good Days'</h4>
        <blockquote>'Good Days' was released in 2022 in SZA's sophomore album 'SOS' which addresses themes of hope, optimism and resilience.</blockquote>
        <h4 class="subheading">'Saturn'</h4>
        <blockquote>'Saturn' was a single released during early 2024 that incorporates themes of personal growth and self-realization.</blockquote>
        <h4 class="subheading">'20 Something'</h4>
        <blockquote>'20 Something' was released in 2017 in SZA's debut album 'Ctrl' that expresses feelings of vulnerability, anxiety and confusion that often come with young adulthood.</blockquote>

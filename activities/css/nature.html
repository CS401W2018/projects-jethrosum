        <h3>Engagement Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.
                <blockquote>
                    Block tags' width and height is determined by the amount of content within the html. Block tags also always starts from a new line, while inline tags don't and only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is normal flow in HTML?
                <blockquote>
                    It's how block and inline tags are used to create the default way of organizing HTML. 
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?
                <blockquote>
                    The float tag allows us to position elements in certain places in our webpage. Clearing the float will position all other elements in their correct positions.
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?
                <blockquote>
                    Relative slides things around but reserves the space. Absolute makes other elements in the webpage ignore the element which this tag is applied to. Fixed fixes the elements in the edge of the webpage. Absolute and fixed is typically used in headers and footers.
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?
                <blockquote>
                    By using "hover" in css.

            <li>
                Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?

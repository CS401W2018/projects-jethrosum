        <h3>Engagement: CSS Selectors</h3>
        <h4>1. List out the different ways to select an item.</h4>
        <p>(1) Tag Name, (2) Descendent (eg. main p), (3) ID and (4) Class</p>

        <h4>2. What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h4>
        <p id ="first">An ID allows us to select all the tags and apply changes to all those tags. For example, (within a tag) id = "first". This name has to be spelled the same way between the html and the css files. You also cannot have any space between multi-word names; only hyphens. To use modify it in the css file, use # then the id name. For example, #first. An ID can also only be used ONCE. With an ID, each tag can only have ONE.</p>
        <p class="second"> A class works almost the same way as an ID but instead of using a hashtag/pound sign, use a period (.). A class can also be used as many times as you want. A tag can also have many classes.</p>
        <p class="pink bigger"> This is an example of a tag with two classes.</p>

        <h4>3. What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h4>
        <p> SPAN tags allow us to modify text within larger tags. For example, this is an <span class="bolder"> example of an application </span> of a SPAN tag.</p> 
        <div class="block">
            <p> DIV tags causes line breaks. DIV tags essentially creates blocks or boxes for texts within it's scope. For example, this is an example of a DIV tag.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>4. What is the difference between an DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h4>
        <p> Header, Main, and Footers tags essentially acts the same way as DIV tags would. It simple makes it easier to locate each section of a web page code.</p>

        <h4>5. What are different ways to select a color?</h4>
        <p> We can select a color by calling it's specific name, selecting the color using a box color selector, and by inputting its color code. </p>

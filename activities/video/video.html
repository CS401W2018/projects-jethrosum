                What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube? 
                <blockquote>
                    Hosting your own videos requires payment and will require those who visit your website to download those videos prior to watching them. 
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    Youtube can host videos for FREE. The downside is that ads or links to other videos may appear on your video.

                What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?
                <blockquote>
                    The transform property allows us to rotate, scale and place elements within our html. 
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    Transition allows us to animate elements.

                How do you stay safe online?
                <blockquote>
                    Some of the best ways to stay safe online is by using strong passwords, using secure networks, and being mindful of what websites we visit and who we communicate with online.

                What is the schedule for the rest of the class?
                <blockquote>
                    We'll have one more engagement on Friday, then we'll just be working on our final exam preparation and final project.

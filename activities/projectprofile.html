    <h1>Jethro Sumiran</h1>
    <p>My full name is Jethro Sumiran, but I've always gone by nickname, Jet. I was born in the Philippines to two faithful and hardworking parents. I have two siblings - an older sister studying here in BYU-Hawaii, and a younger brother who was married last July. I love spending time with my family, and after almost 5 years being apart, my sister and I were able to come home over the summer for our brother's wedding.</p>
    <p>One of my other interests is listening to music. I won't go anywhere without a pair of headphones, and whenever appropriate, I would be listening to some tunes. Although I typically listen to RnB and OPM music, one would find a considerably broad variety of song genres on my playlist. My all-time favorite artist is SZA. </p>
    <ol type = "A">Here are some of my favorite songs (in no particular order):
        <li>"Good Days" by SZA</li>
        <li>"Saturn" by SZA</li>
        <li>"Wildflower" by Billie Eilish</li>
        <li>"Nomad" by Clairo</li>
        <li>"Miss Miss" by Rob Daniel</li>
        <li>"Love to Dream" by Doja Cat</li>
        <li>"Mind-Altering Substance" by JVDAMUSICMAN</li>
    </ol>

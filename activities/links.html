            Engagement - Sep 20
            
           1. Link to an outside website with an absolute link.
                - Done
            
            2. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?
                - An absolute link includes the full website address, while a relative link only shows the path on the same site.
            
            3. Link to another engagement assignment (something in an activity folder).
            
            
            4. List the 3 rules with relative links.
                -  .  means current folder
                -  ..  means parent folder
                -  /  means at the beginning or starting at the root
            
            5. Link to your last project.
            
            
            6. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?
            - No.

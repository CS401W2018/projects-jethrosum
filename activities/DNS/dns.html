                How does SSL work?
                <blockquote>
                    We use security keys (eg. DEZ) to encrypt and decrypt our data to prevent others from obtaining our data in its original readable form. If the public key encrypts data, then the private keys decrypts data, or vice versa.                     Installed in our operating systems, we get a list of certificate authorities we trust. We should rely on this list to ensure that our data is safe.
